This notebook is a collection of python notes, tricks, and tips. It is set up to act as a quick reference for basic Python programming.<!--more-->


# Basic Math


```python
### Most basics
```


```python
print(5+5)
print(4-3)
print(2*2)
print(7/3)
print(7//3)
```

    10
    1
    4
    2.3333333333333335
    2
    

Note that the division sign, "/", is used differently in Python 2 and 3. In Python 2, 5/2 is 2. In Python 3, 5 / 2 is 2.5, and 5 // 2 is 2.

### Exponentiation


```python
print(2**3)
```

    8
    

### Modulo


```python
print(7%3)
```

    1
    

# Strings

## Concatenating strings


```python
a='ab'
c='cd'
print("The easiest way is this: " + a + c)
print("You can also multiply a string by an int to make it repeat: {}".format(3*a))
try:
    a-'a'
except TypeError:
    print('But you cannot do the same with subtraction or division')

```

    The easiest way is this: abcd
    You can also multiply a string by an int to make it repeat: ababab
    But you cannot do the same with subtraction or division
    ['ab', 'cd']
    abcd
    

## Appending


```python
s=[]
s.append(a)
s.append(c)
print(s)
st = ''.join(s)
print(st)
```

    ['ab', 'cd']
    abcd
    

## Removing and changing letters


```python
#String are immutable, so you will have to create a new string each time
old_str = 'Python sucks'
new_str = old_str.replace('su', 'ro')
print(new_str)
```

    Python rocks
    

## Finding a string inside a string


```python
phrase = 'Now for ourself and for this time of meeting'
if 'meeting' in phrase:
     print('found "meeting"')
```

    found "meeting"
    


```python
# Or find the location of the beginning of the string
phrase.find('for')
```




    4




```python
# Index does the same thing when a string is present
phrase.index('for')
```




    4




```python
# When the string isn't there, they differ
phrase.find('fort')
```




    -1




```python
phrase.index('fort')
```


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

    <ipython-input-59-d241ba1fe19d> in <module>()
    ----> 1 phrase.index('fort')
    

    ValueError: substring not found



```python
# Find and index find the first instance. You can also search for the last instance
phrase.rfind('for')
```

## Splitting and joining strings


```python
sen = 'This is my sentence'
# Split into words
words = sen.split(' ')
print(words)
```

    ['This', 'is', 'my', 'sentence']
    


```python
# Join does the opposite of split
another = ['This', 'is', 'another', 'sentence']
' '.join(another)
```




    'This is another sentence'



## Unique words


```python
# The "set" function does this
# Note that we'll have to convert to all lower case beforehand so it doesn't think "this" and "This" are different words
lower = [w.lower() for w in words]
unique_words = set(lower)
print(unique_words)
print("You have used {} unique words.".format(len(unique_words)))
```

    {'is', 'this', 'sentence', 'my'}
    You have used 4 unique words.
    

## Extract longer words from a sentence


```python
# Extract the words longer than three letters
[w for w in words if len(w) > 3]
```




    ['This', 'sentence']



## Capitalization


```python
# Find capitalized words
print([w for w in words if w.istitle()]) # istitle looks to see if first and only first character is capitalized
```

    ['This']
    


```python
# Note that isupper checks if ALL the letters are uppercase
print('This'.isupper())
print('This'.istitle())
print('UPPER'.isupper())
```

    False
    True
    True
    


```python
print('Great'.lower())
print('great'.title())
print('Great'.upper())
```

    great
    Great
    GREAT
    

## More string methods


```python
# Words that end with "y"
[w for w in words if w.endswith('y')]
```




    ['my']




```python
a = 'too many spaces at the end      '
a.strip()
```




    'too many spaces at the end'



# Lists


```python
# Lists are defined using square brackets
a = [1,2,3,4]
type(a)
```




    list




```python
# Lists can consistent of different types, but this isn't common
a = ['This', 'is', 4, 1+4, 's'*3]
print(a)
```

    ['This', 'is', 4, 5, 'sss']
    

## Indexing


```python
# The first item has an print of 0
print(a[0])
# And the last has an index of one less than the number of element
print(a[len(a)-1])
```

    This
    sss
    

## Slicing

List slicing is done by [start : end]
The fist value is included, but the last one isn't, so it looks like [inclusive : exclusive]


```python
# list slicing: [start : end] is [inclusive : exclusive], so the last value is the slice is not included
a[1:3]

```




    ['is', 4]




```python
# Lists also include steps: [start : end :step]
a[0:len(a):2]
```




    ['This', 4, 'sss']




```python
# If you leave them blank, the slicing values will be implied as follows
print(a[0:len(a):1])
print(a[::])
```

    ['This', 'is', 4, 5, 'sss']
    ['This', 'is', 4, 5, 'sss']
    


```python
# So you can just enter the part you want to be different than the defaults
print(a[::2])
print(a[:3])
print(a[:4:2])
```

    ['This', 4, 'sss']
    ['This', 'is', 4]
    ['This', 4]
    


```python
# The end value can be more than the length of the list
a[2:10]
```




    [4, 5, 'sss']



## Other list stuff


```python
# Lists are mutable
a[2] = 'hello'
print(a)
```

    ['This', 'is', 'hello', 5, 'sss']
    


```python
# You can also have lists of lists
list_of_lists= [[1,2,3,4,5], ['a','b','c'], a]
print(list_of_lists)
```

    [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], ['a', 'b', 'c'], ['This', 'is', 'hello', 5, 'sss']]
    


```python

```


      File "<ipython-input-35-ccd4c4cd69ff>", line 2
        list of lists= [['list1', 3], ['list2', 4]]
              ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax
    


# Tuples


```python
# Tuples are defined using parentheses
tu = (1, 2, 3)
```


```python
#tuple are immutable, so the following will give you an error:
tu[2] = 5
```


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

    <ipython-input-108-6f2f318298ea> in <module>()
          1 #tuple are immutable, so the following will give you an error:
    ----> 2 tu[2] = 5
    

    TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment



```python
# Use tuples to flip values
a=1
b=2
(b,a) = (a,b)
print("a is {a} and b is {b}".format(a=a,b=b))
```

    a is 2 and b is 1
    

## Finding a value in a tuple


```python
tu.index(3)
```




    2



# Dictionaries

Dictionaries are implementations of hash tables. They are ver quick for looking up, inserting, updating, and deleting values


```python
# Dictionaries are defined with curly brackets
# Instead of using indexes, uses key-value pairs
entries = {'Alice' : True, 'Bob' : 0, 'Charlie' : 12}
print(entries['Charlie'])
```

    12
    

## Adding values


```python
# First, check it is is already there
print('New' in entries)
```

    False
    


```python
entries['New'] = 'yes'
```

## Exploring dictionaries


```python
print(entries.keys())
print(entries.values())
```

    dict_keys(['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'New'])
    dict_values([True, 0, 12, 'yes'])
    

# Printing

Print is a function in Python 3, so the text to be printed must have parenthesis around it. In Python 2, this was not that case


```python
print("Hello world!")
```

    Hello world!
    


```python
# In Python 2, you can do this
print "Hello world!"
# But it doesn't work in Python 3
```


      File "<ipython-input-137-e74dbf0a8ff8>", line 2
        print "Hello world!"
                           ^
    SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'
    



```python
#printing multiple lines
lines = """Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
The evil that men do lives after them;
The good is oft interred with their bones;
So let it be with Caesar."""
print(lines)
```

    Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
    I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
    The evil that men do lives after them;
    The good is oft interred with their bones;
    So let it be with Caesar.
    


```python
# If you use a comma in the print statement you get an extra space
a = 'Et tu, Brute!'
b = 'Then fall, Caesar.'
print(a + b)
print(a, b)
```

    Et tu, Brute!Then fall, Caesar.
    Et tu, Brute! Then fall, Caesar.
    


```python
# You can print with single or double quotes. This makes it easier to print a single or double quote
print('Antony said "This was the most unkindest cut of all."')
print("For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,\n Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms")
```

    Antony said "This was the most unkindest cut of all."
    For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,
     Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms
    

## Using the format printing method


```python
print('{:.2f}'.format(3.1415))
print('{:.2%}'.format(.333))
print("{perc:.2%}% of {num_verbs} are weak".format(perc=.501, num_verbs=7))
```

    3.14
    33.30%
    50.10%% of 7 are weak
    

# For loops


```python
for i in range(10):
    print(i**2)
```

```python
# Also works with text
for word in ['Beware', 'the', 'ides', 'of', 'March']:
    print(word)

```

    Beware
    the
    ides
    of
    March

# List comprehensions

List comprepensions are an alternative to for loops. Every list comprehension can be rewritten as a for loop, but not every for loop can be written as a list comprehension.


```python
list_of_numbers = [2,54,8,4,26,3,8,3,7]
```


```python
small_numbers = []
for number in list_of_numbers:
    if number < 5:
        small_numbers.append(2*number)
print(small_numbers)
```

    [4, 8, 6, 6]
    


```python
# This can be rewritten as a list comprehension
small_numbers = [2*number for number in list_of_numbers if number < 5]
print(small_numbers)
```

    [4, 8, 6, 6]
    

[Here](http://treyhunner.com/2015/12/python-list-comprehensions-now-in-color/) is a easy to visualize explanation.

# Error handling

There are [a bunch of python error messages](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/standard_exceptions.htm), which are known as standard exceptions. Here are some of the most common

### Index Error


```python
a = [1,2,3,4]
print(a[5]) # There is no element #5, so you get an error
```


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    IndexError                                Traceback (most recent call last)

    <ipython-input-152-3328b7d9ec57> in <module>()
          1 a = [1,2,3,4]
    ----> 2 print(a[5]) # There is no element #5, so you get an error
    

    IndexError: list index out of range


### Name error


```python
my_variable = 4
print(my_veriable)
# I have introduced a typo, so call the variable "my_veriable" returns an error
```


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

    <ipython-input-155-30993cfdcc4a> in <module>()
          1 my_variable = 4
    ----> 2 print(my_veriable)
          3 # I have introduced a typo, so call the variable "my_veriable" returns an error
    

    NameError: name 'my_veriable' is not defined


### Type error


```python
# Trying to use a type in a way it cannot be
print(a[2]) # works fine
print(a['two']) # returns an error
```

    3
    


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)

    <ipython-input-159-45c59a70da68> in <module>()
          1 # Trying to use a type in a way it cannot be
          2 print(a[2]) # works fine
    ----> 3 print(a['two']) # returns an error
    

    TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices, not str


### Syntax error


```python
print("Syntax often result from missing parenthses"
```


      File "<ipython-input-156-edd9a7d47009>", line 1
        print("Syntax often result from missing parenthses"
                                                           ^
    SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing
    


## Try, except statements


```python
#Can also be more specific:

print("If you provide two integers, I will devide the first by the second")
try:
    a = int(input('Give me a number: '))
    b = int(input('Give me another: '))
    print(a/b)
except ValueError:
    print("That's not an int")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Can't divide by zero")
except:
    print("I don't even know what you did wrong")
```

    If you provide two integers, I will devide one by the other
    Give me a number: 2
    Give me another: 0
    Can't divide by zero
    


```python
# You can also use a finally statement to do something even after an error has been raised
try:
    a = int(input('Give me a number: '))
    b = int(input('Give me another: '))
    print(a/b)
except ValueError:
    print("That's not an int")
finally:
    print("Whether there's an exception or not, this runs. Good for closing a file.")
```

    Give me a number: r
    That's not an int
    Whether there's an exception or not, this runs. Good for closing a file.
    

You can also raise exceptions directly


```python
try:
    1/0
except:
    print("I've just picked up a fault in the AE35 unit. It's going to go 100% failure in 72 hours.")
    raise
```

    I've just picked up a fault in the AE35 unit. It's going to go 100% failure in 72 hours.
    


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ZeroDivisionError                         Traceback (most recent call last)

    <ipython-input-172-af3e15a5729f> in <module>()
          1 try:
    ----> 2     1/0
          3 except:
          4     print("I've just picked up a fault in the AE35 unit. It's going to go 100% failure in 72 hours.")
          5     raise
    

    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero


## Assert


```python
def div_by_two(x):
    assert (x%2 == 0), "Number must be even"#Assert that x is even; this makes the program stop immediately if it is not
    return x / 2
print(div_by_two(3))
```


    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    AssertionError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

    <ipython-input-3-00ddaa3cd990> in <module>()
          2     assert (x%2 == 0), "Number must be even"#Assert that x is even; this makes the program stop immediately if it is not
          3     return x / 2
    ----> 4 print(div_by_two(3))
    

    <ipython-input-3-00ddaa3cd990> in div_by_two(x)
          1 def div_by_two(x):
    ----> 2     assert (x%2 == 0), "Number must be even"#Assert that x is even; this makes the program stop immediately if it is not
          3     return x / 2
          4 print(div_by_two(3))
    

    AssertionError: Number must be even


## Python uses references. This can create aliasing problems


```python
# Here's an example that isn't a problem
old_list = [1,2,3,4]
new_list = old_list
new_list[2]=7
print(old_list)
```

    [1, 2, 7, 4]
    

`old_list` has changed without being changed directly. This is because when I did `new_list = old_list`, it created a reference from the value of `old_list` to a new variable, `new_list`. But it did not make a second copy of the value, so they are pointing to the same value. If that value is changed both variables will see the change.

This can be a desired result, but sometimes it isn't. In those cases you can make a copy of the value instead of just getting a reference to the old value. Do this by setting `new_list` equal to `old_list[:]` or `list(old_list)`


```python
old_list = [1,2,3,4]
new_list = old_list[:]
new_list[2]=7
print(old_list)
```

    [1, 2, 3, 4]
    


```python
old_list = [1,2,3,4]
new_list = list(old_list)
new_list[2]=7
print(old_list)
```

    [1, 2, 3, 4]
    

To see this in more detail, you can look at the id of the variable


```python
old_list = [1,2,3,4]
new_list = old_list
print(id(old_list))
print(id(new_list))
new_list = old_list[:]
# By using a copy, new_list gets a different id")
print(id(new_list))
```
