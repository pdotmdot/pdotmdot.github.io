Python offers several different methods for opening text files, but are all options equally good? What's the best method for the generic case of opening a text file?<!--more-->

The most basic is the following:
```python
# Open the file
f = open('file.txt', 'r')
```
The 'r' means that the file is being opened as read-only. The other options are ```'w'``` for write only, ```'a'``` for append only, and ```'r+'``` for both reading and writing. If you use ```'r+'```, you could accidentially write over your file, so it is best to use ```'r'``` unless you specifically want to edit the file.

From there, you can read the file with:
```python
# Read the file
f.read()
```

It's important to always close files after you're done reading them, so the entire code should look like:

```python
# Open the file
f = open('file.txt', 'r')

# Read the file
f.read()

# Do other things with the file


#Close the file
f.close()
```

The problem with this is that if something happens in your code which interrupts the program, the program will abort before it closes your file. What you can do to avoid this is to use a try/finally statement. This way you try a section, and if there's a bug it will end the try section but still complete the 'finally' section, so you can be guaranteed that the file will be closed properly.

```python
# Open the file
f = open('file.txt', 'r')

try:
    # Read the file
	f.read()

	# Do other things with the file


finally:
	#Close the file
    f.close()
```

However, there's an easier way to do this, and that's using the 'with' command. This is the **simple and safe way to open a file**:

```python
# Use a with statement
with open('file.txt') as f:
	# Read the file
	f.read()

	# Do other things with the file
```
Whenever the 'with' statement ends, the file will be properly closed.
