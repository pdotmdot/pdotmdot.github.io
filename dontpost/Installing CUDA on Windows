Installing CUDA on Windows



Start with the CPU version: pip install tensorflow



Windows 7, 64-bit

CUDA used to be an acronym for Compute Inified Device Architecture, but now it's no longer an acronym. It's just CUDA.

This tutorial explains how to make your graphics card, or GPU, faster with machine learning.


How to see if it's working



First, make sure your graphics card is installed properly and allows CUDA. You can either check your graphics card with the DirectX Diagnostic Tool



My preference is to download the tool Speccy:

Then, make sure it is on this list: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus



You will need visual studio for this. You will use it to compile CUDA projects


Check here to make sure your version of Visual Studio can work with CUDA: http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html
Look at Table 2

Note that this is for the most recent version of CUDA, which is CUDA 9.0 at the moment. CUDA 9.0 works with many different versions of VS, but not with Tensorflow


I'm using Visual Studio Community 2017, which I downloaded from the Internet for free.

https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/


To download an older version, you should go here: https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/older-downloads/
You need to join a Microsoft Dev Essentials program, but joining is free

You'll need Visual Studio Community 2015 with Update 3


Make sure you check what version of CUDA to install. The latest version will not necessarily be supported by TensorFlow.

Check here for the version: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_windows




Install the most recent NVIDIA Driver: http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us


Then install the CUDA Toolkit: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads
After you input your operation system information, you have the option of downloading either the network or local installer. Either will work. " The Network Installer allows you to download only the files you need. The Local Installer is a stand-alone installer with a large initial download."


OK, now let's see if that worked

Open a command prompt and enter "nvcc -V"

> nvcc -V

Then, run deviceQuery.exe

You should find it somewhere like C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v9.0\extras\demo_suite
or

C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v8.0\extras\demo_suite


Go to a command prompt and run it by typing "deviceQuery.exe". Note that you cannot go to the folder and double click on it or it will open a command prompt, run, and close too quickly for you to see the results.


Answering this question:


Using these sites:

http://blog.nitishmutha.com/tensorflow/2017/01/22/TensorFlow-with-gpu-for-windows.html


https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_windows - can I update this documentation? Is it open source?



To check your version:

Open a python console

import tensorflow as tf
tf.__version__

Then to upgrade it, pip install tensorflow --upgrade



All those chomping at the bit, just build #master from source. It's not too hard (just time consuming), you get the latest CUDA/cuDNN, and additional optimizations over a pip/whl install (eg, see the CPU optimizations in this tut). Plus next time CUDA/cuDNN upgrade, you can build again w/o having to wait.

When we say building we mean building from source not installing a wheel file. A wheel is already compiled and 1.4 binaries support CUDA 8 + cuDNN 6. To get CUDA 9 you will need to build from source. I have never done the windows build. Once 1.4 ships the team will switch the nightly builds over to CUDA 9.




However, CUDA 8 does not work with visual studio 2017. See here: https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/978691/cuda-setup-and-installation/support-for-visual-studio-2017/post/5113817/#5113817



1.4 is CUDA 8 + cuDNN 6 this will not work with CUDA 9 you will have to compile from source
once 1.4 is released we will work to switch the nightly builds to CUDA 9 and then 1.5 will most likely be CUDA 9.



You can download the wheels from here: https://github.com/mind/wheels/releases/tag/tf1.4-gpu-cuda9

It will not be in the nightly as far as linking to CUDA 9. TF 1.4 is next, which will most likely stay CUDA 8 + cuDNN 6 and then 1.5 would move to cuDNN 7 and CUDA 9 if all goes well. 



So I would recommend going with this build:

Visual Studio 2015


cuDNN

The main page only has the current version, which is 7:

https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn

The archive stops at version 5: https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive

So where to get version 6 and 6.1?


You have to go here to get version 6: https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-download

The tensorFlow documentation says use version 6.1, but I can't find it on their website. But version 6 works

https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_windows


Verifying Visual Studio:

Open the nbody Visual Studio solution file for the version of Visual Studio you have installed. 
Click on the build menu, then click Build Solution
It should say:
========== Build: 1 succeeded, 0 failed, 0 up-to-date, 0 skipped ==========

I did the above but it was after I ran deviceQuery, not sure why I needed to do that


Then get  cuDNN:
the install guide is here:
http://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/cudnn-install/index.html#install-windows

going from here:
C:\Users\HMISYS\Downloads\cudnn-8.0-windows7-x64-v6.0\cuda\lib\x64
to here:
C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v8.0

Copy the following files into the CUDA Toolkit directory.
Copy <installpath>\cuda\bin\cudnn64_7.dll to C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v9.0\bin.
Copy <installpath>\cuda\ include\cudnn.h to C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v9.0\include.
Copy <installpath>\cuda\lib\x64\cudnn.lib to C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v9.0\lib\x64.



These can be either system or user variables:
Variable Name: CUDA_PATH 
Variable Value: C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v8.0

now You can install TensorFlow with:

pip install --upgrade tensorflow-gpu

You can also assign a calculation directly to your GPU and see if that works:

import tensorflow as tf
with tf.device('/gpu:0'):
    a = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], shape=[2, 3], name='a')
    b = tf.constant([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], shape=[3, 2], name='b')
    c = tf.matmul(a, b)

with tf.Session() as sess:
    print (sess.run(c))
Here

"/cpu:0": The CPU of your machine.
"/gpu:0": The GPU of your machine, if you have one.





I don't see anyone doing the following steps:

Include cudnn.lib in your Visual Studio project.
Open the Visual Studio project and right-click on the project name.
Click Linker > Input > Additional Dependencies.
Add cudnn.lib and click OK.
