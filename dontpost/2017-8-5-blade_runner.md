title: Bladerunner: What it got right and wrong
---

The future has come. The futuristic film, Blade Runner, is nearing the present. Set in November of 2019, Blade Runner portrays a dytopian future portrayed in a neo-noir style. Now is a good moment to take a look at what it got right, what it got wrong, and why.



Right:

Resurrgence of AI (even though it was filmed during an AI winter (true?))

Voice interaction with machines




Wrong:

What it predicted incorrectly:
Flying cars
The success of AI


What it missed:

Environmental movement
Social change, role of women
Public health (smoking)



Why:

Social change is nearly impossible to determine
Approval of interracial marraige changes over time.


Flying cars are a stupid idea.
