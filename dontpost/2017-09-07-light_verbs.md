title: How many light verbs are too many?
---

## What are light verbs?
Light verbs are verbs that contain very little information on their own. Verbs such as "to be", "to have", and "to do" are some of the most common light verbs. 

## Why don't we want them?

We don't need to avoid light verbs, but we do want to avoid overusing them. Light verbs can create nominalizations (see the nominalization blog post for more), which can be a drag on an otherwise clean writing style.

Light verbs may contain meaning, or sometimes even a little meaning, so they should not be removed without thought. The point of highlighting them is to suggest you reread those sentences and see if there is a way you can drive the sentence better without the use of a light verb.

## What are all the light verbs?

There's no official list, but I include any form of the following verbs:  *to do*, *to have*, *to make*, *to be*, *to take*, *to begin*, *to get*, *to go*, *to give*, *to put*, *to feel*, *to begin*.

## How bad are they?

Fortunately, it's OK to have quite a few light verbs in your writing. A good way to see this is to look to the classics.

In general, it looks like anywhere between 30-45% of your verbs can be light verbs.



*Light verbs are sometimes called weak verbs, but the term weak verbs can also be used to describe verbs that form a past tense through a standard pattern (walk -> walked instead of run -> ran). To avoid confusion, I use the term "light verbs".
