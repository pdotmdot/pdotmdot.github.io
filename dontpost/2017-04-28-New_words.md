title: New words in 5th edition of the American Heritage Dictionary
---

Looking at words as they officially enter into a language is a fascinating perspective into language and culture. New words provide insight into where the national consciousness is and in what direction it is moving. Some words are new and will be unfamiliar to most, while others have been said hundreds of times and are just now officially entering the dictionary. Many demonstrate new scientific or technological concepts that were never before possible or significant, such as zettabyte, nanobot and carbon footprint. Others are familiar and surprising only in that they were not already in the dictionary, such as dream catcher and Abrahamic. And some words, like farklempt, I'd never heard of before.

From Steven Pinker's *The Sense of Style: The Thinking Person's Guide to Writing in the 21st Century* comes a list of all the new words added to the 5th edition of the *American Heritage Dictionary* (2011), where he sits on the usage panel.
